The above control flows roughly define the functionalities and workflows of the system. An actor is able to access his/her home directory after logged-in. 
One can also register directly through the portal. More specifications and requirements will be provided for assignment #1.

## :fire: Specification - Web Option


### Front-end:
The web application handles a sequence of actions performed by the user on their browser. Consider there are two input domains: the URL input box and the rendered webpage to interact with the users. 

| Pages | The frontend mainly consists of the following pages: |                            |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|       | /login                                               | The user login page        |
|       | /register                                            | The user registration form |
|       | /                                                    | The user profile page      |

| Routes | The frontend mainly consists of the following routes: |             |

### :car: Example frontend test case in natural language:

(full list of selenium action api is [here](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/733b28ffd45533a9e82a834f0b1f3285189895f8/help_docs/method_summary.md))

For frontend test cases, we use mocking (to use a faked backend rather than actually running the backend, see [here](https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/CI-Python#pytest))

Test Data:
```
test_user = User(
    email='test_frontend@test.com',
    name='test_frontend',
    password=generate_password_hash('test_frontend')
)

```

#### Test case R1.3 - If the user has logged in, redirect to the user profile page


Mocking:
 - Mock backend.get_user to return a test_user instance 
 
Actions:
 - open /logout (to invalidate any logged-in sessions that may exist)
 - open /login
 - enter test_user's email into element `#email`
 - enter test_user's password into element `#password`
 - click element `input[type="submit"]`
 - open /login again
 - validate that current page contains `#welcome-header` element
 
 


#### Test case R6.4 - /buy[post] The ticket name exists in the database - positive

Additional Test Data:

```

test_ticket = Ticket(
    owner='test_frontend@test.com',
    name='test_ticket_yo',
    quantity=10,
    price=10,
    date='20200901'
)
```

Mocking:
 - Mock backend.get_user to return a test_user instance 
 - Mock backend.get_ticket to return a test_ticket instance

Actions:
 - open /logout (to invalidate any logged-in sessions that may exist)
 - open /login
 - enter test_user's email into element `#email`
 - enter test_user's password into element `#password`
 - click element `input[type="submit"]`
 - open /
 - enter test_ticket's name into element `#buy_name`
 - enter test_ticket's quantity into element `#buy_quantity`
 - click element `#buy_submit`
 - validate that the `#buy_message` element shows `successful`
 - open /logout (clean up)
 
 Note:
(`get_ticket` and `Ticket` do not exist yet, but it is your initial designs of the backend interface)
(element `#buy_name`,  `#buy_quantity` and `#buy_submit`, etc. do not exist yet, but they are your initial design of your frontent interface)


#### Test case R6.4 - /buy[post] The ticket name exists in the database - negative
(the example above shows the postive case, we need to test the negative case)

Additional Test Data:

```

test_ticket = Ticket(
    owner='test_frontend@test.com',
    name='test_ticket_yo',
    quantity=10,
    price=10,
    date='20200901'
)
```

Mocking:
 - Mock backend.get_user to return a test_user instance 
 - Mock backend.get_ticket to return a test_ticket instance

Actions:
 - open /logout (to invalidate any logged-in sessions that may exist)
 - open /login
 - enter test_user's email into element `#email`
 - enter test_user's password into element `#password`
 - click element `input[type="submit"]`
 - open /
 - enter `test_tickent_nonexist` into element `#buy_name`
 - enter test_ticket's quantity into element `#buy_quantity`
 - click element `#buy_submit`
 - validate that the `#buy_message` element shows `ahhhahhaha the ticket does not exist`
 - open /logout (clean up)
 

## :ghost: BAD Example that You Shouldn't Do:

#### Test case R6.4 - /buy[post] The ticket name exists in the database - positive

Actions:
 - follow the information above to login the webpage
 - input the ticket information into the form
 - make sure that the system checks the ticket's name exists in the database.
