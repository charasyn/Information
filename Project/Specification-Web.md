### :car: Example frontend test case in natural language:

(full list of selenium action api is [here](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/733b28ffd45533a9e82a834f0b1f3285189895f8/help_docs/method_summary.md))

For frontend test cases, we use mocking (to use a faked backend rather than actually running the backend, see [here](https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/CI-Python#pytest))

Test Data:
```
test_user = User(
    email='test_frontend@test.com',
    name='test_frontend',
    password=generate_password_hash('test_frontend')
)

```

#### Test case R1.3 - If the user has logged in, redirect to the uer profile page


Mocking:
 - Mock backend.get_user to return a test_user instance 
 
Actions:
 - open /logout (to invalid any logged-in sessions may exist)
 - open /login
 - enter test_user's email into element `#email`
 - enter test_user's password into element `#password`
 - click element `input[type="submit"]`
 - open /login again
 - validate that current page contains `#welcome-header` element
