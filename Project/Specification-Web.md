The above control flows roughly define the functionalities and workflows of the system. An actor is able to access his/her home directory after logged-in. 
One can also register directly through the portal. More specifications and requirements will be provided for assignment #1.

## :fire: Specification - Web Option


### Front-end:
The web application handles a sequence of actions performed by the user on their browser. Consider there are two input domains: the URL input box and the rendered webpage to interact with the users. 

| Pages | The frontend mainly consists of the following pages: |                            |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|       | /login                                               | The user login page        |
|       | /register                                            | The user registration form |
|       | /                                                    | The user profile page      |

| Routes | The frontend mainly consists of the following routes: |             |

### :car: Example frontend test case in natural language:

(full list of selenium action api is [here](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/733b28ffd45533a9e82a834f0b1f3285189895f8/help_docs/method_summary.md))

For frontend test cases, we use mocking (to use a faked backend rather than actually running the backend, see [here](https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/CI-Python#pytest))

Test Data:
```
test_user = User(
    email='test_frontend@test.com',
    name='test_frontend',
    password=generate_password_hash('test_frontend')
)

```

#### Test case R1.3 - If the user has logged in, redirect to the user profile page


Mocking:
 - Mock backend.get_user to return a test_user instance 
 
Actions:
 - open /logout (to invalidate any logged-in sessions that may exist)
 - open /login
 - enter test_user's email into element `#email`
 - enter test_user's password into element `#password`
 - click element `input[type="submit"]`
 - open /login again
 - validate that current page contains `#welcome-header` element
 
 


#### Test case R6.4 - /buy[post] The ticket name exists in the database - positive

Additional Test Data:

```

test_ticket = Ticket(
    owner='test_frontend@test.com',
    name='test_ticket_yo',
    quantity=10,
    price=10,
    date='20200901'
)
```

Mocking:
 - Mock backend.get_user to return a test_user instance 
 - Mock backend.get_ticket to return a test_ticket instance

Actions:
 - open /logout (to invalidate any logged-in sessions that may exist)
 - open /login
 - enter test_user's email into element `#email`
 - enter test_user's password into element `#password`
 - click element `input[type="submit"]`
 - open /
 - enter test_ticket's name into element `#buy_name`
 - enter test_ticket's quantity into element `#buy_quantity`
 - click element `#buy_submit`
 - validate that the `#buy_message` element shows `successful`
 - open /logout (clean up)
 
 Note:
(`get_ticket` and `Ticket` do not exist yet, but it is your initial designs of the backend interface)

(element `#buy_name`,  `#buy_quantity` and `#buy_submit`, etc. do not exist yet, but they are your initial design of your frontent interface)


#### Test case R6.4 - /buy[post] The ticket name exists in the database - negative
(the example above shows the postive case, we need to test the negative case)

Additional Test Data:

```

test_ticket = Ticket(
    owner='test_frontend@test.com',
    name='test_ticket_yo',
    quantity=10,
    price=10,
    date='20200901'
)
```

Mocking:
 - Mock backend.get_user to return a test_user instance 
 - Mock backend.get_ticket to return a test_ticket instance

Actions:
 - open /logout (to invalidate any logged-in sessions that may exist)
 - open /login
 - enter test_user's email into element `#email`
 - enter test_user's password into element `#password`
 - click element `input[type="submit"]`
 - open /
 - enter `test_ticket_nonexisted_lol` into element `#buy_name`
 - enter test_ticket's quantity into element `#buy_quantity`
 - click element `#buy_submit`
 - validate that the `#buy_message` element shows `ahhhahhaha the ticket does not exist`
 - open /logout (clean up)
 

## :ghost: BAD Example that You Shouldn't Follow:

#### Test case R6.4 - /buy[post] The ticket name exists in the database - positive

Actions:
 - follow the information above to login the webpage
 - input the ticket information into the form
 - make sure that the system checks the ticket's name exists in the database.
 
Why it is BAD? If you give this to someone else and assume that they won't read the specification, can they implement the test code directly based on what you described? We need to provide what is needed in details.
